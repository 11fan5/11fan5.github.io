# Here are some plots
Today we are making interactive plots in plotly. We will make examples using the NYC airbnb dataset.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

Do some initial data cleaning / subsetting
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location/2) %>% 
  select(
    rating, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, 
    room_type, lat, long, price) %>% 
  drop_na(rating) %>% 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  )
```
